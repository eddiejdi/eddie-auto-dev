# ARCHIVED: Fly.io tunnel documentation

This file previously contained detailed Fly.io tunnel configuration and sensitive
operational instructions. Fly.io integration has been removed from the active
repository and sensitive content has been archived.

If you require the original documentation for migration or audit purposes, retrieve
it from your secure backups or from the private git history. Do not reintroduce
sensitive tokens or public endpoints into the working tree.

For current deployment and tunnel instructions, document the chosen provider
explicitly in a secure, access-controlled location outside the public repository.
