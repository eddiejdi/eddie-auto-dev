## Cloudflared config example for homelab.rpa4all.com
# Copy this to /etc/cloudflared/config.yml and replace <TUNNEL-UUID> and paths as needed.

tunnel: <TUNNEL-UUID>
credentials-file: /home/homelab/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-UUID>.json
ingress:
  - hostname: homelab.rpa4all.com
    service: http://192.168.15.2:8503
  - service: http_status:404

# Notes:
# - Ensure the credentials-file exists (created by `cloudflared tunnel create`).
# - Use `cloudflared tunnel route dns <TUNNEL-UUID> homelab.rpa4all.com` to register DNS mapping,
#   or create a CNAME in your DNS that points to the Cloudflare-provided target.
